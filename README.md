# Santtu Niskanen

I'm a 20-year-old student from Finland, currently studying Information and Communication Technology @ **OAMK**. The main programming languages I use are C++, Python and SQL. I have an interest towards DevOps and I have already picked up tools like Docker and Git. Along with the Git I have learned to how to navigate file systems and the use of Bash by running Linux on my other devices and running virtualized Ubuntu through WSL2.
