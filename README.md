# Santtu Niskanen

Hello there! I'm a 21-year-old student based in Finland, currently studying Information Technology at Oulu University of Applied Sciences.
Besides working on software applications, I like Star Wars, mechanical keyboards, music and the nature.

My interests reside in the world of DevOps and Backend Development. I like Linux and I like to live in the terminal.
I'm currently writing a backend application with Golang, and I'm also in the process of learning how to run containerised workloads in **Kubernetes**.
