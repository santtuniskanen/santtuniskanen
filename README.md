# Santtu Niskanen

I'm a 20-year-old student from Finland, currently studying Information and Communication Technology @ **OAMK**. The main languages I've been working on are **Python** and **C**, but I'm always eager to learn about new technologies. Currently dabbling in Front-End Development.

I have also been making music as a hobby for the last 4-5 years:
