# Santtu Niskanen

I'm a 20-year-old student from Finland, currently studying Information and Communication Technology @ **OAMK**. The main programming languages I use are **C++**, **Python** and **SQL**. I have an interest towards **DevOps** and I have already picked up tools like **Docker** and **Git**. Along with Git I have learned how to use **Bash** by running Linux on my computers and running virtualized Ubuntu through **WSL2**.
